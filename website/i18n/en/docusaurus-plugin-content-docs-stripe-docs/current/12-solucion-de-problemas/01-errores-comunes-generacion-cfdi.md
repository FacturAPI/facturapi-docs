# One-Cent Discrepancy in CFDI

When generating a **CFDI in Facturapi** from an **invoice or payment in Stripe**, you may notice a **one-cent difference** in the amounts. This can raise concerns about calculation accuracy and proper CFDI issuance.

### **Why Does This Variation Occur?**
Facturapi, like the **SAT**, performs calculations using **six decimal places** to ensure the highest possible accuracy in determining taxes and totals. However, Stripe may not be applying the same number of decimal places to the products or services registered on its platform.

### **How to Resolve This Difference?**
If the amounts in the **invoice** or **payment** show a **one-cent discrepancy** compared to the **generated CFDI**, it is recommended to check the following:

1. **Check the configuration of products in Stripe**  
   - Ensure that unit prices are recorded with **a maximum of six decimal places**.  
   - If more than six decimal places are used, calculations may vary and cause a one-cent difference in the CFDI.

2. **Review Stripeâ€™s rounding logic**  
   - Stripe may be rounding amounts to fewer than six decimal places before generating the total, leading to discrepancies.

3. **Compare calculations with the SAT methodology**  
   - Facturapi follows the **SAT** guidelines, so performing a manual test using six decimal places is recommended to validate calculations.

ðŸ“Œ **Important Note:** Although the **SAT** allows for a variation of up to one cent due to rounding in calculations, it is advisable to adjust Stripe's configuration to minimize these discrepancies.
