# Send Documents via Email

For now, email delivery can be done from the Facturapi dashboard by selecting the document to send in the [invoices section](https://dashboard.facturapi.io/invoices) and clicking **"Send via email"**.

It is also possible to access the document from the **Facturapi App panel in Stripe**, by selecting an invoice and clicking **"View in Facturapi"**.
