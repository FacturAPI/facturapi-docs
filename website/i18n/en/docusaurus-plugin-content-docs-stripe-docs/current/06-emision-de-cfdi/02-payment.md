## Obtaining Documents from a Payment in Stripe

From a **payment in Stripe**, the following **CFDI** can be generated depending on its relation to an invoice:

âœ… **CFDI for Income PUE**  
âœ… **CFDI for Payment (Type P)**

## **CFDI for Income PUE**  
A **CFDI for Income PUE** will be generated when the payment **is not linked to any invoice**.  
In other words, a **payment without an associated invoice** will generate a **CFDI Type I (Income)**.

### **Steps to Generate a CFDI for Income PUE:**  
1. **Go to the payment details in Stripe.**  
2. **Open the Facturapi App panel in Stripe.**  
3. **Click on "Generate CFDI".**

## **CFDI for Payment**  
A **CFDI for Payment (Type P)** will be generated when the **payment is linked to a Stripe invoice** that **already has a registered CFDI PPD**.

### **Steps to Generate a CFDI for Payment:**  
1. **Go to the payment details in Stripe.**  
2. **Open the Facturapi App panel in Stripe.**  
3. **Click on "Generate CFDI".**

ðŸ“Œ **Note:**  
It is important to verify the **payment's relation to an invoice** before generating the CFDI to ensure the correct document is issued.
