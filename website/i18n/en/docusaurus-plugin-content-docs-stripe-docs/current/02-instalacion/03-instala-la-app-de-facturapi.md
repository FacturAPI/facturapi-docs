# Step 3 - Install the App in Stripe

## How to Install the Application?

1. **Access the Stripe App Marketplace**  
   Log in to your Stripe account and go to the [Stripe App Marketplace](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/facturapi).

2. **Select the Facturapi App**  
   Inside the marketplace, search for "Facturapi" or access it directly through [this link](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/facturapi).

3. **Click on "Install"**  
   Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. Stripe will ask you to confirm the necessary permissions for Facturapi to operate within your account.

4. **Set Up Your Integration**  
   Once the app is installed, follow the next steps within Facturapi to ensure your organization is ready to issue CFDI correctly.

5. **Select Your Organization**  
   You will be prompted to choose the organization you want to connect with Stripe. Make sure to select the one you have correctly set up. If you configure it later, ensure it matches the one connected to Stripe.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Before you can issue CFDI stamped before SAT, make sure you have completed your organization’s setup in Facturapi, including uploading the CSD certificate.

That's it! You now have the application installed in Stripe.
