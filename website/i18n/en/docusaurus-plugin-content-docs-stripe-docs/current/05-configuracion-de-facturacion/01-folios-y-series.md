# Assignment of Folios and Series

When generating invoices through the Facturapi app for Stripe, the assignment of **folio_number** and **series** values is done as follows:

- The **default series and folios** set in Facturapi will be used.
- To configure them, you need to do it from the **Facturapi dashboard** under **Settings > Folio Count**.
- You can access it directly via this link: [Configure series and folios in Facturapi](https://dashboard.facturapi.io/settings/series).
