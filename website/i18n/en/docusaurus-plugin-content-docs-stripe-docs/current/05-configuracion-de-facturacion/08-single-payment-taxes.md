# Taxes on Individual Payments Without an Invoice

## **What Are Taxes on Individual Payments Without an Invoice?**  
This setting allows you to define which taxes will be applied to payments that are not associated with an invoice in Stripe.

## **How It Works**  
- When processing a payment without an invoice in Stripe, the selected taxes configured in the Facturapi App will be applied.  
- One or more of the following taxes can be set with their factor, rate, or amount, as well as whether they are withheld or transferred taxes:  
  - **VAT** (Value Added Tax)  
  - **IEPS**  
  - **ISR**
