# Product/Service Key and Unit of Measure Key from the SAT

## **What are these keys and why are they required?**  
When generating a CFDI, it is mandatory to include two keys according to the SAT catalogs:

- **Product or service key**: Describes the type of good or service being invoiced.
- **Unit of measure key**: Specifies how the product is quantified (e.g., piece, hour, service).

Both keys must be included in each line item to meet the SAT’s tax requirements.

## **How it works**  
You can assign these keys in two ways within the app:

### 1. Default keys  
- If a payment or invoice doesn’t include specific keys, the default ones configured in the Facturapi App settings will be used.
- You can set both the product/service key and the unit of measure key in the **Billing Settings** section of the app.
- This option is useful when all your products share the same classification.

### 2. Product-specific keys  
- You can open each product and access the Facturapi App panel.
- From there, assign a **product/service key** and a **unit of measure key** specific to that product.
- If you already know the codes, you can type them in directly. Otherwise, use the integrated search tool.
- The catalog is based on the official SAT listings and is available within the app for easy lookup.

## Use cases

- **Default keys**: Ideal for businesses that sell a single type of product or service and don't need to differentiate between them for tax purposes. This simplifies setup and maintenance.
- **Product-specific keys**: Recommended for businesses offering multiple types of products or services that need to assign distinct tax classifications per item, ensuring accurate CFDI generation.
