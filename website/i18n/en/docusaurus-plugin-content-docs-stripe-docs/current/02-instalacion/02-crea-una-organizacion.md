# Step 2 - Create an Organization in Facturapi

In Facturapi, you can create multiple organizations based on your needs, but it’s important to choose only **one** to integrate with Stripe. Make sure to configure it correctly before proceeding.

### Steps to Create a New Organization

1. **Access the Facturapi Dashboard**  
   Log in to [Facturapi](https://dashboard.facturapi.io).

2. **Open the Organizations Menu**  
   In the top left corner of the dashboard, click on the dropdown menu.

3. **Create a New Organization**  
   Click on **"+ Create New Organization"**.

4. **Choose the Business Name**  
   Assign a business name to your organization.

### Organization’s Tax Configuration

To issue **CFDI stamped before SAT**, you must complete the tax configuration. This can be done after creating the organization, but it must be completed before generating valid CFDI.

1. **Register Tax Information**  
   Go to [Tax Information Settings](https://dashboard.facturapi.io/settings/legal).  
   Enter the organization’s tax details, ensuring they are **valid and match SAT records**.

2. **Upload Your CSD Certificate** *(optional for now)*  
   Although it’s not immediately required, you will need to [Upload Your CSD Certificate](https://dashboard.facturapi.io/settings/certs) later to properly stamp CFDI. Once added, the **RFC will be extracted from your certificate and automatically assigned to your organization**.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Without a valid CSD, you will only be able to generate test invoices. To issue real invoices before SAT, make sure to complete this step.

Once you have completed these steps, your organization will be ready for integration with Stripe and CFDI issuance.
