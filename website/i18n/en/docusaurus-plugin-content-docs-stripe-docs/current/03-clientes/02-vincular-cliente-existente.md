# Link Existing Customers

For this step, the customer you want to link must already be registered in Facturapi.

This process allows a Stripe customer to retrieve the tax information of a customer previously registered in Facturapi.

### Steps to Link an Existing Facturapi Customer in Stripe:

1. Open any customer in Stripe.
2. In the Facturapi App panel, select **"Link an Existing Facturapi Customer"**. This option will appear if the Stripe customer does not have tax information.
3. Search for and select the required customer.
4. Click **"Select"**.

Once this process is completed, the customer in Stripe will be linked to its corresponding record in Facturapi.
