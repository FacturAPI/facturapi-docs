# Default Product Key


## **What is the Default Product Key?**  
The default product key defines the product or service code that will be used when generating a CFDI if none is provided in the invoice or payment.

## **How It Works**  
- If a payment or invoice in Stripe does not include a specific product key, the key configured in the Facturapi App settings will be used.  
- This key can be changed based on the type of products or services the business invoices.

## **Use Cases**  
- Ideal for businesses that sell a single type of product or service and do not need to specify different keys for each transaction.
