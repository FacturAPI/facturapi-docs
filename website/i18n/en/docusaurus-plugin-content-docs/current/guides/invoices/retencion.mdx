# Retention Invoice

The retention invoiceis a different document from a standard invoice, meaning
it is not an income, expense, or transfer CFDI and therefore has a different
structure. It consists of general data and can have a complement added to it.

## What is it used for?

The retention invoice is used to inform the SAT (Mexican tax authority) about
the tax withholdings that have been made to a third party, as well as to report
payments made to foreign residents. It is also used in transactions such as the
sale of shares, payment of dividends, royalties for copyright, deductions of
real interest for mortgage loans, and lottery prize payments, among others.
