# Organizations (Multi-RFC)

## Register multiple issuing organizations

You can issue invoices from different tax identification numbers by registering
new issuing organizations, either from your dashboard or using the API, with
the Create Organization method, as well as the other methods to configure tax
data, logo, colors, certificates, etc.

:::info
Remember that to create and manage organizations, you must authenticate using your User Key,
which is a secret key associated with your entire account. You can find it in your
[Integration Center](https://dashboard.facturapi.io/integration).
