# Send Documents via Email

For now, email delivery can be done from the Facturapi dashboard by going to the [invoices section](https://dashboard.facturapi.io/invoices), selecting the document you want to send, and clicking **"Send by email"**.

You can also access the document from the **Facturapi App panel in Stripe** by selecting an invoice and clicking **"View in Facturapi"**.

This feature is still under development.  
We are working to enable document issuance automation.
