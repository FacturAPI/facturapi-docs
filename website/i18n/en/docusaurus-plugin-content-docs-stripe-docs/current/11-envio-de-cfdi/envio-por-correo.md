# Send Documents via Email

You can send documents by email from your Facturapi dashboard by going to the [invoices section](https://dashboard.facturapi.io/invoices), selecting the document you want to send, and clicking **"Send by email"**.

You can also access the document from the **Facturapi App panel in Stripe** by selecting an invoice and clicking **"View in Facturapi"**.

If you prefer, you can enable **automatic email delivery** when invoices are created by turning on the automation here:
