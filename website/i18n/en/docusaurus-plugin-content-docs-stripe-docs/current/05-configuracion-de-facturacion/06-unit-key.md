# Default Unit Key

## **What is the Default Unit Key?**  
The default unit key defines the unit of measurement that will be used in the generated CFDIs if no unit is specified in the invoice or payment.

## **How It Works**  
- If no unit is provided in the payment or invoice in Stripe, the unit key configured in the Facturapi App settings will be used.  
- This key can be modified based on the type of products or services the business handles.

## **Use Cases**  
- Useful for businesses that invoice services and do not need to specify a different unit for each CFDI.
