# Send Documents via Email

To send a CFDI by email, select the corresponding document, open the Facturapi App panel in Stripe, expand the CFDI details, click on the three dots, and choose the “Send by email” option.

You can send it to the email address your customer has on file, or manually enter a different one.

Additionally, you can enable **automatic email delivery** when invoices are created by turning on the automation here:
